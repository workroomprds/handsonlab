# Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes
*Basics:* Work together to defuse a ticking bomb from hidden instructions

*Source:* [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](http://www.keeptalkinggame.com)

*Output:* Poster with 3 comms rules-of-thumb, for asymmetrical groups with lots of info to communicate 
across narrow-bandwidth in limited time.

## Purpose
Reflect on dealing with asymmetrical information across a narrow channel in limited time.

## Requirements
One machine with license, one manual, group of 2-6. Note: Manual is a .pdf

## Logistics
Bring a printed manual – single sided is easier to use. 

Set up laptop beforehand with game. Note that game is on Steam, so may need internet access to authorise. Authorise well before you kick off – Steam can be twitchy about conference wifi. A mouse works better than a trackpad for many people.

You’ll need at least two participants. Best to have 3-6. Split into one defuser, the rest experts. If more, expect more confusion – so perhaps indicate that some should observe.

For a positive experience, it’s best to start with the most-basic bomb in the tutorial – the other starting choice (the 3-module 5-minute “Free-play” bomb) often has more complex modules. For groups without a fluent shared language, or in a noisy environment, consider offering a shared cheat sheet of modules. Consider setting the bomb to take longer.

Be aware that this can be a surprisingly stressful game, particularly for the defuser.

*Setup:* Take 3-5 mins to explain idea, show manual, show a bomb. Allow defuser to get familiar with controls / moving the bomb. Allow “experts” to familiarise themselves with the manual.

*Debrief:* 5-10 mins at end. Aim for 3 rules, written up, to share. Heading: “Narrow, Asymmetric Communications”

## Process
* For each bomb, play game against the clock. 5 mins per bomb is the game default.
* Perhaps have an observer / clock manager / guide.

*Turnaround:* short debrief – “what will we keep” / “what shall we try next” / “what just happened?” / “what was different”. Consider swapping defuser. Consider stress on individuals. Allow group to reflect, set approach, take on roles.

Watch for…
* The ways that roles emerge
* Experiments, and how the group reacts to any results
* How people change their environment
* How the group as a whole gets better, and why


## Versions:
30 minute version – 25 mins available playtime means 2-3 bombs.  Continue into break with more bombs, harder bombs, or with new people. Build on / use the comms ideas.

45 minute version – 40 mins available playtime means 4 bombs. Can perhaps pause for reset and rules-of-thumb halfway through.

## Bonus
Consider where this applies in testing, and illustrate by linking the comms principles (on the poster) to specific testing contexts and actions.

Play "Keep talking and nobody explodes"

Here's the [Game](http://www.keeptalkinggame.com "Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes") – James and Bart have a copy each. 

Here's the [bomb manual](http://www.bombmanual.com "Bomb Defusal Manual").

We'll be in 1-2 groups, depending on how many bombs (and people) we have. Each group needs one Bomb Disposer (who interacts with the bomb via the computer) and a bunch of Bomb Disposal Experts (who have the manual, but not the bomb).

We'll play the game a couple of times, then work in our groups to create some communication rules-of-thumb to share.

This exercise explores how we communicate in assymetrical groups with lots of information, a single narrow channel, and limited time.
