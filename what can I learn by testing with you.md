# What Can I Learn by Testing with You?

*Basics:* What Can I Learn by Testing with You? - an exercise in testing together

*Source:* Lunchtime workshops

*Output:* List of things we've learned from each other, 

## Requirements

A few subjects to test that can be explored easily in minutes by anyone without much setup, enough people to make as many groups as subjects.

## Logistics

2 minute intro, then 3 parts, each of 10 minutes testing and 5 mins debrief, and a 10-minute round-table at the end is an hour long.

Note: for chatty groups, 10 mins may be too short. Prefer communication over timeboxing, so be prepared to bin the 3rd round.


## Process

In each round, each group will test together, in some way. Then they talk about what they've done, within their group.

Next round, they change subject (and focus) and do it again. 

When everyone's tested the same things at the end of several rounds, they'll summarise to the room with individual stories.


**Introduce**: "Discovery may be systematic, but it's not standard. You have things here to explore and to test â€“ but those test subjects are the medium for exploring testing. The aim is to /share/ testing, not to /test/ any particular subject. So watch and listen as much as you test."

Focus hack to distract from judgement of individual performance: give all the groups the same observation aim for each round. Potentially, during the round debrief, ask everyone to consider the same question.

**First round focus**: Observe the differences between how you start and how you end.

**Second round focus**: Observe the way that your group organises itself

**Third round focus**: Observe how you *support* other people, and how you *lean on and build on* others' work.

In the **Summary**, use two questions: what did you lean from someone else, what did you learn about yourself (espec if you'd consider making a change)
Go round the group twice, once for each question.

## Versions

The order of the rounds doesn't matter. Switch them. Try these alternatives.

* Observe the differences between approaches
* Observe the way that your group manages its work and takes decisions
* Observe how someone else *supports* the group, and anhy work that is *based on activity / information from elsewhere* in the group.


Switch one person from group to group each round.

Ask, in the sharing section, for something { specific | wooly | tiny | universal | surprising | confirmatory } about { you | them | testing | technology | data | tools | organising | priorities | change | environment | observations | triggers | connections }. Vary your question each round. Don't exepct everyone, or most people, to answer. Welcome useful things tht diverge from what you've asked for.

## Website text / abstract

We'll split into groups. Each group will work together to test something for a few minutes. I'll give you something to think

At the end of that testing time, you'll talk to each other, in your groups about what you've learned from each other.

We'll switch subjects, and test again.

After 2-4 rounds, we'll gather and summarise.
