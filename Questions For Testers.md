# Questions for Testers

*Basics:* A card game to get testers talking

*About:* Small connections help people become closer

*Source:* Sussed cards game

*Output:* A room full of conversations

A short game to help testers build connections.

Make a group. Distribute cards. Take turns. Each turn, one of you reads a question, and its options, out loud – then chooses one option, privately.

The reader may give points to anyone who predicts (or sways) their choice.

Points are pointless.

NB: Everyone can give the reason for their choices, if they like. Some people may be open to persuasion.

## Notes for players and facilitators :

Setup and Timing: A small group can deal with a question in anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes. More (much more) when the conversations get going. So if you have groups of 4, you'll need around 5 minutes to get through a round of one question each. At the other end, this game gets stale after much more than 20 minutes.

This game has no winner.

This is /not/ a game about finding out information, necessarily. It's about the conversations that happen around those nuggets of information. Encourage each other's surprise, greet their scepticism when they wonder "Why would you do that?".

Players should at least try to stick within the constraints of the available answers – choosing between equally-silly options /is/ the game. If people propose a further, "more right" answer, the activity becomes about what's /right/ rather than what's personal. It becomes more judgemental and less playful.

Players might find it hard to answer a question. If it's you, and you don't want to pick another question, don't be concerned, but do wonder. If you want to get unstuck, you could use one of these tricks:

* Add one word to the question (keep the answers)
* Ask your group for which answer (and why) they've picked for you
* Invert your round: which answer would you throw away?
* List the answers, ask the group for a question, award points 
* Pick another question (or another card) 
* Say you're finding it hard, ask for help, and consider why you're stuck.


This game works fine without a facilitator. If you're a faciliator, be clear in your own mind about why you've taken that role. 

You may find that the volume increases over the first few minutes, and drops after 15. Look for poeple smiling, include anyone who's looking confused. Mix things up by moving between groups. Encourage people to play with the game (that's why the points are pointless).

Some thoughts about how to wrap up:

* As a closing question, "What would you like to share" tends to be more open than "What was your favourite question" or "What did you learn".
* With a team who know each other well, pay attention to collective surprises and points where individuals have changed their minds. Allow those conversations to grow after the end of the game.	
* With a group who don't know each other well, you could, in the conclusion, ask people whether some of them were suprised by something they learned about themselves. People often are, and sharing that can make the group receptive to more chances to change.
* If groups hack points, share how. Messing about with pointless points can be a good distraction from over-serious attention to questions.
* Avoid "What did you learn about someone else?", as whoever is picked out may be uncomfortable withe the attention. Try "Did you say anything that surprised those around you?".
