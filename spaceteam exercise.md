# SpaceTeam
*Basics:* Work together to repair a spaceship when none of you have all the controls

*Source:* SpaceTeam (iOS / Android game)

*Output:* A poster of communication principles when lots of people are talking to each other.

## Requirements:
### Handheld devices
* 2-8 people
* 2 or more iOS / android devices, each with the game, each on the same wifi. 

NB: The handheld game uses a “waiting room” metaphor. For larger groups consider staggering group starts so that they use different waiting rooms. Alternatively, use a handful of a “team” passwords and use internet, or use hotspots / routers with different SSIDs. Bluetooth restricts to similar OS. 

### Card game
* 3-6 people (anecdotally up to 10 w/o mods. However game sellers have expansion packs for larger nos.).
* A pack of SpaceTeam cards

## Logistics: 
Need 30 mins or more.

If there are many people, consider using observers. Alternatively, consider having mainly observers, and increasing player-group size for later rounds.

If using Observers, consider whether observers should suggest improvements.

### Card game
Game is on a timer. Instructions / available timer is 5 mins per round.

There’s a 2-min explainer at https://www.playspaceteam.com/howto . 

While the group watches the video, facilitator can set up the deck (see instructions) dependent on time and difficulty. Game is harder if you use more cards.

### Hand-helds
The handheld game takes as long as it takes, typically 1-3 mins a sector. Perhaps stop after a few sectors/rounds and replay.

Allow at least 5 mins to get s/w downloaded and devices all in the same waiting room.

Note that sectors get harder in unpredictable ways.

## Process: 

Use several rounds, brief debrief after each. Set aside time at end to debrief exercise.

*First Debrief:* Consider what events went well, what went wrong, observations. What might change things? The group may want to find consensus, or to try an experiment. Alternatively, everyone writes down (no need to agree) 1 principle by which they’ll play the game next time. 

*Further debriefs:* Reflect on the experiment / consensual hypothesis / individual principles. What did players appreciate from each other? What effects were observed by group / observers? Write up principles.

*Turnaorund:* Consider shuffling teams / changing size and using (or incorporating) observers.

*Final Debrief:* aim for 3 rules written up to share. If you need a title, try one of: “Listening – and making life easier for your listeners”, “How to manage a shouting match”, “Making overlapping communications clearer”.

## Versions:
30 minute version – 5 mins setup, 15 mins available playtime = 2-3 rounds, 7 mins conclusion.
45 minute version – 5 mins setup, 30 mins available playtime = 4-5 rounds, 10 mins conclusion.

## Bonus
Consider where this applies in testing, and illustrate by linking the comms principles (on the poster) to specific testing contexts and actions.

## Web page text
We’ll be in groups to play [SpaceTeam](http://spaceteam.ca/ "Spaceteam — A Game of Cooperative Shouting for Phones and Tablets").

Everyone in a group needs to fix the same spaceship – but the tools and information needed to fix the ship aren’t usually near what needs to be fixed. One person in each group will be the observer.

Some groups will play SpaceTeam on their phones. One group can play the [card game](https://www.playspaceteam.com/ "Spaceteam - A Chaotic and Cooperative Card Game"). Video instructions [here](https://www.playspaceteam.com/howto "How to Play Spaceteam").

After each game, we’ll talk about what went well, what went badly. We’ll each write down a principle that we’ll play by in the next game. We may shuffle ourselves between SpaceTeams.

We’ll debrief after a few games by discovering which principles seemed appreciated by team members. We’ll make a poster to share.

This exercise explores how we manage communication across many channels simultaneously.

SpaceTeam is free to play on iOS and Android.
