# Estimate exercise

Read the context. Walk through the scenarios as a group. Pair up for the exercise. Share what you learned.

### Context
We have 2 people on a 2 week sprint.
We have a prioritised backlog of tasks.
We imagine that a small task is 1 day, a large task 5 days

Delivery is important to the delivery manager.
Having everyone fully-used is important to the project manager.
Having the right deliverable is important to the product owner.

The following scenarios cover a single sprint. We’ll look at the scenario and what happened, and see what we’ve learned.

---
## Scenario 1
We plan 20 small tasks, and do them
5 take 0.5 day each, 10 take 1 day each, 5 take 1.5 day each

What have we learned?

---
## Scenario 2
We plan 20 small tasks, and do them
5 take 0.2 day each, 10 take 1 day each, 3 take 3 days each, 2 don’t get done.

What have we learned?

---
## Scenario 3
We plan 4 large tasks
One takes one person 8 days. One takes 4 days. The other two are both halfway-done

What have we learned?

## Exercise

Pair up. Take the same context as above. You’ll be coming up with scenarios, and working out what happened.

One person (planner) sets out a scenario. That scenario should include a plan (what collection of small / large tasks), and an outcome (what was done). Both these things should be revealed - and the planner should have an idea of what happened (be realistic, please) to get from plan to outcome. They keep that story to themselves - it’s up to the enquirer to discover what happened.

The enquirer gets to ask questions, based on the results. The Planner’s answers must be honest and consistent with the ‘story’. Try to exercise your mind by interpreting, rather than asking ‘what happened’

Look at the interpretations, and mis-interpretations, and how you surprise each other.
