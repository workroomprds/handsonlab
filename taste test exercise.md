# Taste Test

*Basics:* Taste Test - develop your judgement and palette. Using chocolate.

*Source:* Experimentation and Diagnosis workshop

*Output:* Picture of different dimensions of assessment, and where participants preferences fall. To act as a trigger / example for conversations about quality.

## Requirements

Stuff to taste.

A shared flipchart / whiteboard, and as many colours as subjects.

Something hygienic-ish for identifying and sharing samples. We used plates with letters drawn on.

## Logistics

Setup takes 5 mins. Tasting and assessing 4 kinds of chocolate across 2 groups typically takes 15 minutes. Each further sample takes ~5 mins. Marking assessments takes a few more. Give at least 10 mins to talking about the experiment and about quality.

Start with a pair comparison, and work up. Look at how different groups interact with the same scales / qualities. Look at where the same subject arrives at widely-different places. Consider calibration, differences between individuals, differences between groups. Consider preference vs quality and how one might assess quality separately from personal preference.


## Process

Consider what’s to be tested, and a few ways in which we might differentiate. Pair / group similar things on a scale, have others as present / absent (or weak / strong) qualities. Put scales / qualities on a flipchart with enough space / available colours to add each group’s assessment of all subjects.

Split into groups, each with a couple of of subjects to taste. Everyone tastes, agrees in their groups about where to put the subjects on the scales

Whole room: Record each group’s results on the same board / paper. 

Taste again, swapping / rotating subjects, adding to scales.

Repeat, perhaps with subjects that fall outside existing sameples (ie start with all-dark chocolate / hard cheese, introduce novelty chocolates / blue cheese).

Ask individuals (not groups) to mark their preference on each scale at the *end* of the tasting.

Introduce a few definitions of quality, highlight the difference between quality and perception, and open the conversation.

We'll take something that exists in a range of flavours – chocolate, cheese, beer. We'll have 5-10 things to taste, and enough of them that we stand a chance of each having 3-5 small samples.

Individually, we'll taste two, identifying key differences.

We'll pair up to compare those two (so 2-4, depending on overlap) and our analysis. In pairs, we'll add more, so that each pair has 5 things. Those pairs will create a list of potential properties and ranges they've seen. We'll keep an eye on how our lists grow – and on the differences we see between tasters as well as between subjects.

We'll get into larger groups, comparing our lists, sampling more. We may, individually, identify those properties, and the points in their ranges, where we feel that quality is higher. 

We'll debrief with questions about what "quality" might be for these subjects.

This exercise explores the ways we move from specifics to generalisation via classification.

This exercise explores the ways we experience things, and how we try to share that experience with classification.

Can we arrive at an objective assessment of quality from our collective subjective experience?
